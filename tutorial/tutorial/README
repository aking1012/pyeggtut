simple tutorial

the package name is tutorial

in order to set up an egg you need a setup.py file.  you can use the one here as a template.
you have to include subdirectory/submodules in the setup.py file or you'll get import errors.
when you import the module you don't import the root classes directly so you need to call them like this:

import tutorial
tutorial.tutorial.helloworld()

you could:
from tutorial import tutorial
tutorial.helloworld()

i like including the entire package so you don't get some dependency hell that
doesn't get caught during development

to build(after you install setuptools):
python setup.py bdist_egg

to install:
sudo easy_install tutorial-0.1-py2.7.egg

to use:
python
>>>import tutorial
>>>tutorial.tutorial.helloworld()

to test before you build the egg go to the same directory as your setup.py and try the same.

if it works that way and you get import errors when you install the egg you missed a module directory.

you don't have to worry about creating build, dist, or egg-info directories...setuptools does that for you.
you'll find your egg in dist
